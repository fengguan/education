# Group Study projects

## JulyEdu Paper translation
* what is the goal of this translation project?
 * Helping people who don't have or lack the ability to read English papers
 * demonstrate JulyEdu's research power
 * prepare for Research Paper classes
 * Testing for class-project community
* SWOT(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats)
 * strengths: group members are currently active and well organized. We already have roadmap, and enough papers to continue.
 * weakness: lacking of paper quality control, may not able to demonstrate our power, translation is time consuming, not using standard publish venue, not good for broadcast. 
 * opportunities: we may be able to put in source code of algorithms in those paper, and let students/instructors to test and play with(This probabily be the most interesting thing). GitHub as central publish venue.
 * threats: group member may lose interests as time goes on, if paper quality not good enough, may have negative effect.
* improvement suggestions:
 * water print
 * abstract only, fast translate and broadcast
 * put the translated abstract to our public acount of wechat/QQ/sina and other channels.
 * let each paper has a translator's introduction(This is good for share knowledge and will make translators more serious)
 * regulate everyone's translation to github
 * do not change too much of current organization, preventing to hurt group members morale.
