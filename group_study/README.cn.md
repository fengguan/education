#### 翻译组希望达到的目标是什么?
 * Helping people who don't have or lack the ability to read English papers
 * demonstrate JulyEdu's research power
 * prepare for Research Paper classes
 * Testing for class-project community
 
#### SWOT(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats)
* strengths: 
 1. group members are currently active and well organized. 
 2. We already have roadmap, and enough papers to continue. 
 3. Good Motivate Mechanism.
* weakness: 
 1. lacking of paper quality control
 2. translation is time consuming, 
 3. not using standard publish venue, not good for broadcast. 
* opportunities: 
 1. we may be able to put in source code of algorithms in those paper, and let students/instructors to test and play with(This probabily be the most interesting thing). 
 2. GitHub as central publish venue.
* threats: 
 1. group member may lose interests as time goes on, 
 2. if paper quality not good enough, may have negative effect.

#### Improvement ideas
 * **adding water print**--(simple change)
  - I have an instruction on group tutorials
 * **abstract only, fast translate strict quality contral, and broadcast**--(easier for quality contral and broadcast and avoid negative effect of bad translations)
  - strict quality contral, need help from professional instructors, i.e. Han and others
  - need to initialize projects for abstract translation.
  - This step we can require translator's introduction as well.
 * **put the translated abstract to our public acount of wechat/QQ/sina and other channels**--(broudcast our results)
  - need help from sales team
 * **Also let students in QQ/wechat select the favorite paper they want to know details**--(prepare for research paper class)
  - also need help from sales team
 * **let each paper has a translator's introduction**--(This is good for sharing knowledge and will make translators more serious, better for quality contral)
  - I will start with the current paper on my plate.
 * **merge all translation to github**--(together with broadcasting in wechat/QQ)
  - I can help move the historical translations to github
  - also write instructions for members to construct new paper directories.
