* Boltzmann machine & Ising model
  * phase transition
* representation arbitrary distributions (Boltzmann machine & Ising model)
* Training of this model (layer by layer)
  * difficulty in training Boltzmann machine directly.
    * intractible partition function
    * intractible inference
* applications: auto-encoder
