## Interpretation of classic
I want to start reading/interpreting a series of classic results from: 
* Information theory(Shannon)
* computability theory(Turing, Godel)
* quantum information(Shore, Preskill)
* foundation of mathematics(Rusell, Wittgenstein)
* basic quantum mechanics([Dirac](http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/wasbleibt/57355817/57355817.pdf))
* QFT()

## 管中窥豹
what is the relationship between a problem with 200 years history and a mathematics theory araised from last centry?
What is that mathematician doing!
