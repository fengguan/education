### IMO problems

Problems are downloaded directly from the official web-sit [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx).

Geometry Graphs are so far generated from a very nice [geometry tool](https://www.math10.com/en/geometry/geogebra/geogebra.html)

I will try to record my thought and feelings when working on these problems. It will not be a complete record, but I think it should be somewhat interesting when I look back after several years: I may be laughing at myself that I only did half problem over the years...
