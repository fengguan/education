    * Sundial is natually a round
  * line is easier to be straight.
    * straight line is easier to be used to divide land

  * How to measure how many event happend within a period of time.
    * let's look at a longer period of time
  * How to measure how long it will take to complete one event.
    * Let's look at more event counts
  * Is there any relation between these two things?
