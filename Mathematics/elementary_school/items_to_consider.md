## History
* Example1: Why people use circle to measure time and using line to measure length?
  * circle is compact, and the smaller and easier to take. 
    * Sundial is natually a round
    * It is OK to use one pointer and one long stripe to measure time, but you can not put it on your whist.
  * line is easier to be straight.
    * straight line is easier to be used to divide land
    * theoretically one can use a wheel to measure land, but it is too hard to make your path to be straight.
## Practice
* Example1: 
  * How to measure how many event happend within a period of time.
    * let's look at a longer period of time
  * How to measure how long it will take to complete one event.
    * Let's look at more event counts
  * Is there any relation between these two things?  
## Generalization
* Example1:
  * measure is to compare two different unit
    * How many days in one year? 365 days?
    * Why there is leap year every 4 years? 
      * what is the error of using days to measure years, roughly?
